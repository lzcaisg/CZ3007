/************************ MY RULES STARTS HERE!!! ************************/

/* 1. ================================= 
A module consists of the keyword module, followed by an identifier (which is the module’s
name), followed by an opening curly brace, followed by imports, followed by declarations, followed by a
closing curly brace.
=======================================*/

Module = MODULE ID LCURLY Imports Declarations RCURLY;


/* 2. ================================= 
A module’s imports (nonterminal Imports) specify what other modules this module will import. They
consist of zero or more import statements. An import statement (nonterminal Import) consists of the keyword
import, followed by an identifier, followed by a semicolon. The identifier is the name of a module to be
imported.
=======================================*/

Imports = Imports Import
		|
		;

Import = IMPORT ID SEMICOLON;


/* 3. ================================= 
A module’s declarations (nonterminal Declarations) consist of zero or more declarations. A declaration is
either a function declaration, or a field declaration, or a type declaration.

A function declaration consists of an accessibility specifier, a type name, an identifier, an opening
parenthesis, a parameter list, a closing parenthesis, an opening curly brace, a possibly empty list of statements,
and a closing curly brace.

A field declaration consists of an accessibility specifier, a type name, an identifier, and a semicolon.

A type declaration consists of an accessibility specifier, the keyword type, an identifier, a single equals
symbol, a string literal, and a semicolon.

- An accessibility specifier consists of either the keyword public, or of nothing at all.

- A type name is either a primitive type, an array type, or an identifier.

- A primitive type is one of the keywords void, boolean and int.

- An array type is a type name, followed by a left bracket, followed by a right bracket. (Hint: In order to
avoid LALR conflicts, you will need to expand the definition of the array type nonterminal as discussed in the
tutorial.)

- A parameter list is a possibly empty list of parameters separated by commas. A parameter is a type name
followed by an identifier.
